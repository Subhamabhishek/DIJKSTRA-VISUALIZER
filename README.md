# DIJKSTRA-VISUALIZER
This project is a visual representation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a grid. Users can set start and end nodes, add walls, and visualize the algorithm in action.

Features
Set Start Node: Allows the user to set the starting point for the algorithm.
Set End Node: Allows the user to set the endpoint for the algorithm.
Add Walls: Users can add walls to the grid, making the algorithm find an alternative path.
Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm: Starts the visualization of Dijkstra's Algorithm from the start node to the end node.
